A rough collection of all files created when learning to implement various ML algorithms.
At present, these mostly include implementations based on the wonderful curation of lectures from Andrej Karpathy (i.e., his zero to hero lectures). As such, none of it will be based on independent and new ideas but rather a re-creation of implementing what the lectures teach, but at the same time these will not be a complete copy-paste job either.
Over time, I aim to include more that reflects a more independent approach to implementing different ideas. As they get added, I will highlight them here.
